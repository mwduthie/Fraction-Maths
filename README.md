# Fraction-Maths
Simple console based program that gives you the results of adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing two fractions.
Not completely functional, for our lab the first fraction was always larger than the second and no calculation would result in division by 0. 

For example 1/2 - 2/3 = 1/-6 which is incorrect.
